Explore2019 Planet Data API Workshop Exercises
----------------------------------------------

Interactive exercises for the Planet Data API workshop at Planet Explore on Wed
Oct 16th, 2019

These jupyter notebooks are intended to give you a solid overview of the
low-level mechanics of Planet's Data API.  The exercises are in Python, but are
deliberately intended to be language agnostic.  The focus is on interacting
with the REST API, and understanding the Planet-specific concepts involved in
searching for scenes.
